## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

I would like to be able to create some sort of functioning product such that I
can begin transcribing some of the music that my taiko club has. The feeling of
having completed a product from scratch is extremely satisfying as it gives a
tangible product you can show off to others. 

I also want to focus on the skills that come with developing a product, rather
than focusing entirely on the technical level. This is where language design
comes into play, as you'd want to make sure that it is user-friendly while still
getting things done. This will most likely require a lot of revising. That's
okay, though, because you can rarely get things right on the first try.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

Calling back to one of the earliest exercises in this class, I'd like to work on
creating a product not just for me, but for the intended audience. That is, I
should be continiously checking in with other people to see if what intuitively
makes sense to me also makes sense to them, and seeing if there are any features
that I'm missing that they would fine helpful (among other things). I feel like
when I work on projects, I tend to tunnel-vision on what I want and not others,
so it would be good to work on that.

This is kind of a stretch goal but I'd also want to work on building a GUI that
isn't webdev based, just because I've already done a lot of webdev. However,
this isn't that related to DSLs, hence why I say it's a stretch goal; it might
be more efficient to just work with what I already know.

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

I'll set dedicated DSL hours so that I can force myself to sit down and work on
it. I'm thinking one day could be Monday 3pm-5pm. I'll add another day if that
seems insufficient. 

Here are some milestones that might be helpful:
- sketch design and what the sheet music might look like. can also sketch gui if
  helpful
- create a very barebones gui so that I can start writing the code that will
  actually produce the sheet music
- get basic notes working (quarter note, at the bare minimum, + rests). will
  also have to create some sort of empty sheet music template to place music on
- once I'm able to place basic notes, refine from there

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

N/a, working alone.

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

I'll be prompt about providing feedback so that my classmates can see it as soon
as possible. Furthermore, I'll read their documentation/journal carefully so I
understand their thought processes before providing feedback. Attendance is also
helpful so that I can talk to them in person if needed. 

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

I think I'd be proud of the entire project as a whole, no matter what it may
look like by the end of the semester. The entire concept of creating something
for a specialized field is just very cool to me, even if other people may not
understand what exactly the specialized field is. If it also gave more people
exposure to taiko, that'd be cool! We're always looking for new members lol. 

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

I think an A- would be having a barebones GUI with which you could play with the
language described. It might not be entirely functioning, but the essentials are
there and the rest is just a matter of detailing/enhancing. An A would still
have a minimal GUI (mostly because that's not the focus of DSLs) but I'd have a
bit more expressiveness/flexibility by adding support for transcribing taiko
music. For example, I've thought about having a library of common rhythms so
that instead of having to repeatedly create the same rhythm over and over, you
could just save a specific rhythm and copy&paste that.
